class Digraph(nx.DiGraph):
    """
    A directed graph wrapper around networkx.DiGraph with additional
    functionality for storing vertex metadata, computing distance matrices,
    and weighting edges.

    Each node stores two attributes:
    - bin: the corresponding bin/vertex label
    - count: an integer count associated with that bin
    """

    def __init__(self, adjacency_matrix, vertices, counts, loops: bool):
        """
        Initialize a directed graph from an adjacency matrix.

        Parameters
        ----------
        adjacency_matrix : ndarray of shape (n, n)
            Binary or weighted adjacency matrix describing directed edges.
        vertices : list of length n
            Labels for the vertices (e.g., bin indices).
        counts : list of length n
            Associated counts for each vertex.
        loops : bool
            Whether to keep self-loops (True) or remove them (False).

        Notes
        -----
        - If 'loops' is False, the diagonal of the adjacency matrix is
          zeroed out before graph construction.
        - Node attributes 'bin' and 'count' are set from 'vertices'
          and 'counts' respectively.

        Compute a pairwise distance matrix between all nodes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        method : {'unweighted_shortest_path', 'weighted_shortest_path', 'probabilistic'}
            The distance definition:
            - 'unweighted_shortest_path': Shortest path length ignoring weights.
            - 'weighted_shortest_path': Dijkstra shortest path using edge weights.
            - 'probabilistic': Inverse of edge weights treated as distances
              (experimental).

        Returns
        -------
        D : ndarray of shape (n, n)
            Distance matrix, where 'D[i, j]' is the distance from node 'i' to
            node 'j'. Unreachable pairs are assigned a large value (1000).

        Notes
        -----
        - The distance matrix is also stored as self.D.
